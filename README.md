# netbackup

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcopaganini/netbackup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcopaganini/netbackup)

Netbackup is a frontend for various backup programs (rsync, rdiff-backup, rclone).
It simplifies the task of making local and remote backups by "standardizing" the
your backup configuration.

For now, this project is under heavy development and I expect to have something
user ready in a few weeks.
